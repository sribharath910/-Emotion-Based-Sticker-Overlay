# 3D-Face-Reconstruction-Turning-2D-images-into-3D-models

# Abstract:
3D face reconstruction is a cutting-edge technique that transforms 2D images into detailed 3D facial models using deep learning and computer vision. This project aims to develop a real-time system capable of reconstructing 3D faces from single or multiple 2D images with high accuracy. By leveraging deep neural networks, particularly 3D Morphable Models (3DMM), Deep3DFaceRecon, and GAN-based texture mapping, the system extracts facial features, estimates depth, and generates a realistic 3D mesh.

Key components include face detection, feature extraction, 3D shape regression, and texture mapping, optimized using CUDA, ONNX, and OpenGL for real-time performance. Applications of this technology extend to augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), gaming, biometrics, and digital avatars, enhancing user experiences across various domains. This project explores innovative methods to improve reconstruction accuracy, optimize computational efficiency, and expand real-time applications for both web and mobile platforms.
